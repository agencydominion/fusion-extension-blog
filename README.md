# Fusion Extension : Blog

### Extend Fusion with a Blog Element.

The Blog element displays a roll of all posts created on the site anywhere you place it. You can customize what gets displayed on the roll for each post; mix-and-match displaying one or all or a few of the following: Featured Image, Excerpt, Author, Date, Categories, and Tags.

The element is pagination-ready and outputs the number of posts-per-page set on WordPress' Settings->Reading page.
